# js13k Server Boilerplate

* Author: Zak Henry <zak@4mation.com.au>

***

## Prerequisites

1.  Git Installed
2.  NodeJS Installed (http://nodejs.org)
    See notes below for extra steps if using Windows Git Bash.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo
    ```sh
    $ https://github.com/xiphiaz/js13k-server-boilerplate.git your-game-name
    ```

2. cd into directory
    ```sh
    $ cd your-game-name
    ```

3. Install Global NodeJS modules (sudo should not be needed, if you get errors see (http://stackoverflow.com/a/21712034)
    ```sh
    $ npm install -g grunt-cli
    ```

4. Install Local NodeJS modules
    ```sh
    $ npm install
    ```
5. Edit the config .json files (./package.json, ./src/game.json, ./src/game/package.json) to your game name and info
    * note the ./package.json "name" attribute - this is used later to install your game to the sandbox server

6. Run Grunt task
    The following happens:
    * Code is linted and copied into build folder, index.html has it's assets (js/css etc) linked
    * Built code is minified, application javascripts is concatenated into bin folder
    * All code is archived into a .zip (Check your output is under 13k!)
    ```sh
    $ grunt
    ```

# Development
While developing, you can use the grunt task
```sh
$ grunt watch
```
To watch the files that have been changed to automatically complete the build process.

# Testing in js-game-server (https://github.com/aurium/js-game-server)

1. Complete the installation in the readme
2. Test the example games are working at http://localhost:3000
3. cd into the games folder (current default is ./examples, though this may change soon
4. Symlink your game build folder into the games folder.
    Example:
    ```sh
    $ ln -s ~/sites/js14k/your-game-name/build your-game-name
    ```
5. Restart the server
    ```sh
    $ cd <js-game-server dir>
    npm start
    ```
6. Test your game
7. To test your compiled and minified game, symlink the bin folder instead.

Happy programming :)
